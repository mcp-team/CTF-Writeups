# CTF-Writeups
This repository exists for McMaster Competitive Programming students to upload their solutions and writeups to Cybersecurity and Capture The Flag challenges. This will hopefully serve as a place for students to publicly and proudly display their writeups and as a guide and teaching resource for future students.

# Repository Structure
- The top level directory will have directories for each website / platform / event.
- Those directories may have further subdirectories by problem category (e.g. in a Jeopardy CTF there may be pwn, crypto, networking etc.)
- **Each problem shall be its own directory**
- The code for solutions can be submitted in whatever language was used (e.g. `.py`, `.js`, `.sh` etc)
- Writeups will preferably be in Markdown, Text, or LaTeX or another source-controlled file format. Please avoid binary files like `.docx` and `.pdf`.
